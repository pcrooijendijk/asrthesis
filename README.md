# Parkinson's Disease Severity Prediction Using Speech Features

## Description

This project aims to predict the severity of Parkinson's Disease (PD) using speech features. The study investigates various speech features, such as MFCC, Chroma, and their delta features, to determine their influence on predicting the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. A Transformer model is employed to analyze the data and derive meaningful insights.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature extraction from speech recordings.
- Implementation of a Transformer model for regression tasks.
- Evaluation of model performance using various metrics (MAE, MSE, accuracy).
- Comparison of different speech features in terms of their predictive power.
- Visualization of training loss curves and model predictions.

## Results

- The results of the training and evaluation are saved in the `results/` directory.
- Training loss curves and confusion matrices are saved as images for easy visualization.

## Acknowledgements

- This project uses data from the study conducted by [Author et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1234/doi).
